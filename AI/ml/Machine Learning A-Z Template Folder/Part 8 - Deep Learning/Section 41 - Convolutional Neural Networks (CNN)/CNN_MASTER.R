CNN in R
Section 32, Lecture 203
Hello students,

hope you enjoy your Machine Learning journey so far.

In the previous section, we used the powerful H2O package in R to build an ANN 
for a Business Problem.

If you use H2O to build a CNN for Computer Vision, H2O comes with a framework
 called Deep Water.

However, this Deep Water framework is still in early stage, and its final
 version hasn't be released yet. It is preferable to wait for this final
 version before making some tutorials about CNN in R. 
 Therefore I will directly move on to the last two parts of this course, 
 
 Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction and 
 
 Part 10 - k-Fold Cross Validation, Gradient Boosting & XGBoost. 
 
 Then I will go back to this Deep Water framework as soon as it is ready.
