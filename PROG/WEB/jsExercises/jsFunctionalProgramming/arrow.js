When you just need a simple function with one argument, the new arrow function syntax is simply Identifier => Expression. You get to skip typing function and return, as well as some parentheses, braces, and a semicolon.

(I am personally very grateful for this feature. Not having to type function is important to me, because I inevitably type functoin instead and have to go back and correct it.)

To write a function with multiple arguments (or no arguments, or rest parameters or defaults, or a destructuring argument) youâ€™ll need to add parentheses around the argument list.
