/*
CHALLENGE #1:
-- Change the code above to execute 100 factorial computations concurrently and in parallel.
-- Use the "pipeline" pattern to accomplish this

POST TO DISCUSSION:
-- What realizations did you have about working with concurrent code when building your solution?
-- eg, what insights did you have which helped you understand working with concurrency?
-- Post your answer, and read other answers, here: https://goo.gl/uJa99G
