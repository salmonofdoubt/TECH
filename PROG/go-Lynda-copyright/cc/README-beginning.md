1. Your Guide
	* When I first started learning Go ...
		* wild, unchartered territory
			* no online trainings
			* read books translated from chinese
	* I'm leading you on a journey
		* solving computational problems using the Go programming language
		* we'll be going into the jungles of code so I thought you might like to know a little bit about whose leading you into this often treacherous territory.
			* Will I keep you safe from the alligators of algorithms?
			* Will I be able to navigate the congo of concurrency?
			* And will I lead you to some great realization at the end of our journey?
			 	* Will we meet Kurtz and finally understand the heart of computation?
	* Ok, enough with the analogy - a little about my background
		* I'm a self-taught coder
			* learned a lot of what I know right here on Lynda.com
		* my formal educational background
			* bachelors in econ from University of California Santa Cruz
			* MBA, with en emphasis in finance, from California State University Fresno
		* I do not have a formal comp sci background
			* there are holes in my comp sci knowledge, and when I fall in them, they're deep
		* that said, through many late nights, I've learned enough that now I'm
			* tenured faculty in CIT at Fresno City College
			* adjunct faculty in Comp Sci at CSU Fresno
		* my specialization is teaching web programming using the Go programming language
	* Alright, so are you ready for some adventure?
		* My goal is to show you the lay of the land when it comes to using Go so that, when we're done, you will know this territory thoroughly enough to navigate through it with skill
		* So grab your indiana jones hat and get your bullwhip, because this boat is leaving from the dock and we're going to head up river and start wrangling some code
1. My Teaching Style
	* I'm here for you
	* teach you how to use Go
		* I'm assuming you're here to learn Go
		* I don't want to just show you a solution, I want teach you how to create a solution
		* teach through example
		* code review, not coding
			* allows for effective learning
				* pause video, try to understand code, then continue video
				* keeps your brain engaged and active, not just passively watching
		* give you too much, as opposed to not enough
		* point out useful resources
		* give you an awesome code base
			* examples that show you different patterns in Go
	* If I talk too fast for you:
		* slow me down - not everyone knows they can slow a video down
		* rewatch the video
	* David Gassner's "Up And Running With Go"
	* most consumable solution
		* I'm aiming for 
			* the most consumable solution
			* solutions that teach you important concepts about the language
			* not always going to achieve this, but that's what I'm aiming for
	* important: my focus isn't on the solution, my focus is on helping you learn Go
	* Go idioms
		* idioms defined
			* idioms - patterns of speech
				* cultures / sub-cultures have their own patterns of speech
			* language to describe the language
		* "idiomatic Go"
	* Go vs Golang
		* golang.org
			* official website
			* resources for learning
				* https://golang.org/doc/
1. Why Go?
