// Declare a struct type named Point with two fields, X and Y of type int.
// Implement a factory function for this type and a method that accepts
// this type and calculates the distance between the two points. What is

// Add imports.

// Declare struct type named Point that represents a point in space.

// Declare a function named New that returns a Point based on X and Y
// positions on a graph.

// Declare a method named Distance that finds the length of the hypotenuse
// between two points. Pass one point in and return the answer.
// Formula is the square root of (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2
// Use the math.Pow and math.Sqrt functions.

	// Declare the second point.

	// Calculate the distance and display the result.
