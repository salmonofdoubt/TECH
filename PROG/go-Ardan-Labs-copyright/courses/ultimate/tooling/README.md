## Ultimate Go - Tooling
This material covers a good portion of the tooling that comes with go. Specifically we cover testing and benchmarking. We also cover profiling memory and the scheduler. Finally we learn how to read stack traces.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*
