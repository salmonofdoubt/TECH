When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. It's one's duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to <a href="#prestwick-vocab-imp-1-3" class="tooltip" onclick="return false;">conduce</a> very much to either one's health or one's happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful <a href="#prestwick-vocab-imp-1-20" class="tooltip" onclick="return false;">scrapes</a>. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.</span>
